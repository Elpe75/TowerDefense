How the game works:

Launching: From the towerdefense directory, run "javac Game/Game/Game.java" followed by "java Game/Game/Game.java".

Gameplay:

After launching the game, you will have three options: Play, Settings, and Quit.

In the Settings, you can choose the difficulty level, game mode (Marathon / Normal), map, and display mode (Text or Image). The text version replaces the terminal display.
Once your settings are configured, return to the menu and press Play.
In-Game:

You will primarily manage the purchase or sale of towers, which is accessible via the tower buttons, initially represented by a sand icon.

Clicking a tower button will open a menu in the center of the screen, where you can select your tower.
To sell a tower, simply click the button again.
Player information (health, resources, score, and pause button) is displayed at the top of the screen.

You can access Settings and other sections via the Pause button.
